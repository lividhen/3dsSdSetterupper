# 3ds CFW Sd Setterupper
## What is this?
This is a small personal script I use to grab all the files needed for installing custom firmware and putting them in the correct spots.  
Just thought I'd share it since I have found it useful.  
This script is intended to be used in conjunction with [3ds.hacks.guide](). It just quickly grabs the needed files. Currently there are only scripts for seed miner with USM but I may make ones for kartdlphax and skatehax in the future if I or anyone else needs it.

### Usage

Run script and follow instructions.

### Use case? 

Uh... Good question! Very... Good question... 
I suppose there are a couple different reasons you would need this. If you're like me and you just have a lot of consoles to mod (my own, friend's, etc) it is for that. I suppose you could also use it for automating most of a paid modding service, but since it's so easy that does feel a tad scammy. Overall, quite a niche script. Not many people will need this.
