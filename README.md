# 3ds CFW Sd Setterupper
## What is this?
This is a small personal script I use to grab all the files needed for installing custom firmware and putting them in the correct spots.  
Just thought I'd share it since I have found it useful.  
This script is intended to be used in conjunction with [3ds.hacks.guide](). It just quickly grabs the needed files. Currently there only scripts for seed miner with USM but I may make ones for kartdlphax and skatehax in the future if I or anyone else needs it. 

--------
### Usage

Run script and follow instructions.
