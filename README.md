## What is this?
This is a small personal script I use to grab all the files needed for installing custom firmware and putting them in the correct spots. 
Just thought I'd share it since I have found it useful.


--------
##### Something on [3ds.hacks.guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide) got updated or changed!
Please open an issue and I will update my script to reflect it.

##### An app is out of date!
If somebody knows how grab the latest version from github every time, please let me know. But for now just create an issue and I will update it in the script. You can also submit a pull request.

#### Linux or MacOS?
I am working on a linux version, but I don't have access to a mac to make sure it will work on there too.
